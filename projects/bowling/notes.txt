logic

STRIKE - needs to look at max next two rolls if they are both strikes
SPARE - needs to look at max next one rolls

needs to hold max 3 rolls in memory then clear it

if strike - note strike in memory somewhere
if second strike - note in memory somewhere
if third strike - first strike score is calculated (30). 
                - initial strike removed.
                - this strike added.
if 4th strike - second strike is calculated (30). 
                - second strike removed
                - this strike added
if 5th strike - thrid strike is calculated (30).
                - third strike removed 
                - this strike added
    if not strike e.g. first ball of frame is 6
                - 4th strike is calculated (26)
                - 4th strike removed
                - second ball is 

needs to hold max 3 balls at a time
